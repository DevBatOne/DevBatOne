# Hi, I’m Gino 👋

**IT Operations • Systems & Networking • Hardware tinkerer living in Colombia**

I’m a U.S. military veteran turned IT professional, currently focused on building a portfolio of practical IT projects. I enjoy combining **systems administration** with **hands-on hardware work** like designing buck converters and building lithium battery packs.
